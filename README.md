# Portfolio Project - Module 2

## Description

 The task was to create a website from scratch that displays sections about me, my portfolio of webpages, and my contact information. The navigation links, when clicked on, move to the desired sections on the webpage. Also, the website is responsive to all screen sizes with a minimum screen size of 280px.
